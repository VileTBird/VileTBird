I'm an ML systems and performance engineer in training, currently focused on CUDA and machine learning performance. I'm working through an ML internship and am especially interested in low-level development. My background spans full-stack applications, game development, and computation-heavy tools, so I'm open to a wide range of roles as a generalist. If you have any contract opportunities or offers, feel free to email me at **asuraspru@gmail.com** or DM me on Twitter:  <a href="https://twitter.com/bozo10n" target="_blank">@bozo10n</a>

Tools I've worked with:

    ML Performance: CUDA-C

    Machine Learning: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, SQL etc

    Game Development: Unity, C#

    Full Stack: JavaScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, Angular, and others
